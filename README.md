# Quattro Rebrand: Final Integrated Project

This repo is for Semester 2's Final Integrated Project in Fanshawe's IDP3 Program

This project involves taking a defunct beverage brand from a list provided by the course instructors and rebranding the product with our own logo, colours, typography, etc. 
We'll be responsible for creating a 3D model of the product as well as building a 3+ page responsive website across mobile (412px), tablet (768px), and desktop (1200px). All pages are designed and wireframed in Figma, then developed using CSS Grid layouts with validated HTML.

The design should follow the students completed design system, focusing on consistency, alignment, contrast, typography, colour, UX/UI, and visual balance. Each page demonstrates principles of responsive design and accessibility while maintaining a cohesive brand experience.

## Features & Requirements:

✅ Responsive layouts for mobile, tablet, and desktop
✅ A stylized contact form
✅ Product Cards using JavaScript arrays
✅ Show/hide functionality (hamburger menu, product cards)
✅ Proper Git workflow (branches, pull requests, merges)
✅ Includes wireframes and supporting assets

## Installation: 

1. Download or clone the project repository from GitHub.
2. Open the project folder on your computer.
3. If you are using Sass (SCSS), make sure you have Sass installed on your system. You can install it globally using the command: npm install -g sass, or if you’re working in VS Code, you can install the live sass compiler extension.
4. Compile the SCSS files into CSS before running the project. You can use the Sass watch command to automatically compile changes as you edit your styles.
5. Once the SCSS files are compiled, all styles will appear in the CSS folder and be linked to the HTML files.

## Usage

1. Open the index.html file in your web browser to view the project.
2. You can also use a local development server such as Live Server to preview your site and test interactive features.
3. Navigate through the available pages to explore the design. 
4. Test the interactive features, including:

    - To be updated.

5. To make updates, edit the HTML, SCSS, or JavaScript files as needed. The SCSS files will need to be recompiled into CSS after changes are made.
6. Follow standard workflow practices when updating the project. Create a branch, make your changes, commit them, and then merge them into the main branch.
